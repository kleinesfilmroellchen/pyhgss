Python Hypertext Generation Scripting System (PyHGSs)
=====================================================

(This package is to be pronounced 'pyjiss'.)

A simple server system that serves Python CGI scripts, Python code with a special environment that allows it to generate HTML and do other server-side processing. These scripts are called "Python Hypertext Generator Scripts", or PyHG Scripts.

The main way of using this library is with the command-line interface. However, the individual units can also be used to integrate PyHGSs into other systems, like other servers.
